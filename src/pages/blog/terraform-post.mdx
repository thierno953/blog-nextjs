Hello World!


## How can you check the most memory intensive running tasks ?

The built-in `top` command provides a dynaminc real-time view of running system.

### What are log files and where can you find them ?

Log files are the records that Linux stores for administrators to keep track and monitor important events about the server, kernel, services, and applications running on it.

Linux provides a centralized repository of log files that can be located under the `/var/log` directory.

The log files generated in a Linux environment can typically be classified into four different categories:

- Application Logs
- Event Logs
- Service Logs
- System Logs

```bash
variable "ec2_instance_type" {
  type = string
  description = "Instance type to use when launching the instance"
}

variable "ec2_ami" {
  type = string
  description = "AMI to use when launching the instance"
}

variable "ec2_key_name" {
  type = string
  description = "Key name to use when launching the instance"
}
```
# Description

This challenge is about monitoring linux system. So I'll show you the most important responsabilities of a system administrator. So to achieve this purpose, I'll complete two tasks:

1. Task 1: researching how to monitor a linux system (summarize into a file).
2. Task 2: practicing monitoring and write a system report.

# How to monitor a linux system ?

Monitoring a system means monitoring the server performance. The server hosts
services/applications and it's really important to make sure they are available,
reliable and secure.  
The best way to tackle this question is to answer the following questions:

## What are the main area of concern when monitoring a linux system ?

Below is a non-exhaustive list of main area to monitor:

- CPU and Memory usage.
- Disk utilization.
- Running and active processes.
- Running and active disk files, network sockets and devices.
- Network traffic: incoming and outgoing packets (TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ...)
- Network Bandwidth utilization.
- User activity.

## How can you check the most memory intensive running tasks ?

The built-in `top` command provides a dynaminc real-time view of running system.

```bash
resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
  instance_type          = var.ec2_instance_type
  ami                    = var.ec2_ami
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${data.aws_security_group.existing_security_group.id}"]
  subnet_id              = "${data.aws_subnet.existing_subnet.id}"
  key_name               = "${data.aws_key_pair.existing_key_pair.key_name}"
}
```
