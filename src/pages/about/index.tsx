                . I work with javascript technologies, such as ReactJs and
                NextJs, but also have a solid background in Java, which I have
                utilized to develop APIs and backend logic with Spring Boot.

                I got started in my career in engineering while studying
                computing at Manchester Metropolitan University. Since then, I
                have continued to grow my skill set as a consultant, working in
                various projects, some of which you can find on{" "}

                Recently I also began sharing my experiences and knowledge
                through blog posts and videos. These cover subjects and
                technologies that I have recently worked with, as well as my
                findings and learnings. Additionally, I have been working on
                small side projects in my spare time and publishing them as open
                source projects on GitHub. With a goal of helping others who may
                encounter similar challenges in their work.
